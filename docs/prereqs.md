# 1. AWS IoT Secure Tunneling Demo Prerequisites

*Note: You can run this demo either with AWS Cloud9 or AWS CloudShell.  If you want to leverage [AWS CloudShell](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/) please use these [prereq docs instead](./prereqs-cloudshell.md).*

## Setup Cloud9 Environment

Before you can start, you have to make sure your AWS Clpoud 9 environment is up and running and current.  Navigate to the Cloud9 console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloud9

Once you navigate to the Cloud9 console, click on the create environment button:

Type a name for your environment and click **Next step**:

**Make sure you choose Ubuntu** as the platform. The reason for that is that this demo provides a copy of the distributables of local-proxy previously built for Ubuntu. Leave all the rest with the default configuration, and click **Next step**:
